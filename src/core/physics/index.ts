/**
 * Health Data Bricks - Physics Module
 *
 * AI-Native physics-inspired algorithms for health data processing.
 * Inspired by the Unified Syntropy Math-Physics Kernel (USMK) framework.
 *
 * Core Principles:
 * - Free Energy Principle: Only store surprising data
 * - Closed-form Continuous Dynamics: Handle non-uniform sampling
 * - Least Action: Minimal interventions for maximum impact
